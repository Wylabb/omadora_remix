# Omadora

This is my minimal functional install of Hyprland on Fedora, based on the Omarchy implementation and patterns.
This provides a more stable release cycle with tested and curated packages.

Omadora purposely does not include all the apps and features included with Omarchy.
It is intended to be a minimal install that matches the base functionality to allow users to build from.
However, as the implementation closely matches Omarchy, adding features from Omarchy should be simple.

Read more at about Omarchy itself at [omarchy.org](https://omarchy.org).

## Important

Omadora attempts to only install packages from the official Fedora repositories, currently with the exception of a few Hyprland related packages.
These are provided by the [solopasha/hyprland](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/solopasha/hyprland/) COPR, and as such, users should perform their own due diligence to ensure Omadora is safe to install.
